Welcome! I'm a Ph.D. student in Transportation Technology and Policy at University of California, Davis. I'm  supervised by [Dr. Alan Jenn](https://www.alanjenn.com/) at [EV Research Center](https://ev.ucdavis.edu/), Institute of Transportation Studies. My research lies in the intersection between transportation and energy systems. I build models to quantify impacts of electric vehicles on power grid and the environment, and research on engineering and economic solutions to climate change in the EV era.

I received my Bachelor of Engineering and Master of Philosophy degrees from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/). In between, I worked in transportation, creative industries and NGOs. When I'm not working, I'm either swimming, traveling or couch potatoing with my cat.
